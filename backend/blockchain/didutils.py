    We support four DIDs: ebsi, elsi, ala, peer.
    Until EBSI is operational, we have made a basic implementation on Red T.

    The method for Legal Entities is did:elsi, where their DID is public and well-known.

    The name ELSI stands for (E)TSI (L)egal person (S)emantics (I)dentifier, and corresponds to the 
    information that should be included in the "organizationIdentifier" attribute as described in the
    European Norm ETSI EN 319 412-1, related to digital signatures, peer entity authentication, data
    authentication as well as data confidentiality.

    The structure of the DID (after the initial "did:elsi:" prefix) is:
       - 3 character legal person identity type reference;
       - 2 character ISO 3166 [2] country code;
       - hyphen-minus "-" (0x2D (ASCII), U+002D (UTF-8)); and
       - identifier (according to country and identity type reference).

    For the three initial characters ETSI EN 319 412-1 gives two options, but for the moment we
    only support the first one:
       - "VAT" for identification based on a national value added tax identification number.

    For example, the DID for Metrovacesa (metrovacesa.com) is "did:elsi:VATES-A87471264"
